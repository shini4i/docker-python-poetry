## Project Description

This project aims to provide pre-built docker images with python and poetry.

The naming convention is as follows:
```
ghcr.io/shini4i/python-poetry:<python_version>-<poetry_version>
```
Python version is the version without a patch number, e.g., `3.9`, and the poetry version is the version with a patch number, e.g., `1.2.1`.

> Additionally, if there is a necessity to use a specific python version, it is possible to use a tag with the patch number, e.g., `3.9.7-1.2.1`.
